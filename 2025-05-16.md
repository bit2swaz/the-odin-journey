Day 4 - 16th May, 2025

### What I Worked On:
- Finished CSS Foundations entirely (all lessons + updated the 'odin-recipes' HTML project to integrate CSS)
- Polished styling using all concepts learned so far:
    - Selectors, Box Model, Typography, Inheritance, Cascade, etc.
- Started Flexbox module:
    - Completed up to Alignment
    - Did 3/7 exercises on Alignment lesson

### Key Learnings:
- How to structure and style HTML projects with a more professional, modular feel
- Practiced organizing content into reusable, styled sections using `div`, `ul`, `a`, etc.
- Began internalizing how flex container & main axis work â€” powerful layout tools coming up

### Challenges:
- Energy tanked post-midnight â€” had to stop after 3 exercises in Alignments
- Realized how uncomfortable it feels when not spoon-fed in projects â€” but thatâ€™s where real growth is

### Plan for Tomorrow (Day 5):
- Finish Flexbox module (including remaining assignments + 'Landing Page' project)
- Start JS Basics
- Finish it until 1st project 'Rock Paper Scissors'
