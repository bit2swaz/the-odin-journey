##  Day 8 of 1461: The Odin Journey

**What I worked on:**
- Completed all remaining Arrays and Loops assingments from Foundations (including repeatString, reverseString, removeFromArray, etc.)
- Started with DOM Manipulation module
- Made 5+ commits today
- Pushed myself despite major mental fatigue

**What I struggled with:**
- Arrays and loops took WAY longer than expected. Could read code but struggled to write from scratch
- Almost gave up during the assignments due to mental exhaustion and frustration
- DOM concepts felt overwhelming after that, couldn't absorb too much by the end

**Tomorrow's goal:**
- 

**Wins today:**
- 

1 week through. And we're just getting started.
