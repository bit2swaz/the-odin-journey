# The Odin Journey

Welcome to my public learning log and execution journal as I build my way through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s Fullstack Web Development curriculum.

This repository is my **accountability tracker**, where I document my **daily progress**, **struggles**, and **breakthroughs** as I learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and eventually dive deep into backend, databases, and fullstack application development.

## Why this exists

Most people learn in silence. I want to learn **out loud**—to show what it actually takes to go from 0 to professional, one consistent day at a time.

This repo serves 3 purposes:

1. **Proof-of-work**: Every day I ship something, no matter how small.
2. **Accountability**: I track my learning journey publicly, no hiding.
3. **Inspiration**: For others starting from scratch — this is how it looks.
