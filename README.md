# The Odin Journey

Welcome to my public learning log and execution journal as I build my way through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s Fullstack Web Development curriculum.

This repository is my **accountability tracker**, where I document my **daily progress**, **struggles**, and **breakthroughs** as I learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and eventually dive deep into backend, databases, and fullstack application development.
