# The Odin Journey

Welcome to my public learning log and execution journal as I build my way through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s Fullstack Web Development curriculum.

This repository is my **accountability tracker**, where I document my **daily progress**, **struggles**, and **breakthroughs** as I learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and eventually dive deep into backend, databases, and fullstack application development.

## Why this exists

Most people learn in silence. I want to learn **out loud**—to show what it actually takes to go from 0 to professional, one consistent day at a time.

This repo serves 3 purposes:

1. **Proof-of-work**: Every day I ship something, no matter how small.
2. **Accountability**: I track my learning journey publicly, no hiding.
3. **Inspiration**: For others starting from scratch — this is how it looks.

## Structure

- **Logs** → Daily learning logs (What I worked on, Struggles, Goals, Wins)
- **Projects** → Mini projects built along the way (like Rock Paper Scissors, AuraCalc, etc.)
- **Experiments** → Playground for random JS/HTML/CSS practice
- **README.md** → This file you're reading

## Current Status

- **Stage**: **Foundations Course - COMPLETED!**
- **Progress**: **100% Complete**
- **Projects Completed in Foundations**: **5** (including Rock Paper Scissors, Etch-A-Sketch, Flexbox Landing Page, and AuraCalc Calculator)
- **Next Milestone**: Comprehensive revision of Foundations and preparation for Full Stack JavaScript.
- **Next Path**: Fullstack JavaScript (Node.js + MongoDB), officially starting **May 26th, 2025**

## Daily Execution Philosophy

- **No zero days**: Minimum 1 commit daily  
- **Push through friction**: If it’s hard, I’m probably learning  
- **Grind in public**: Transparency > perfection  
- **Aim**: 1 Cr+ in-hand income straight out of college through skill + leverage
