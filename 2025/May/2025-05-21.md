## Day 9 of 1461: The Odin Journey - Powerhouse Day!

**What I worked on:**
- Absolutely crushed the **DOM Manipulation and Events** module, gaining full command over dynamic UI interactions.
- Successfully completed **TWO major projects**: the challenging Etch-A-Sketch (with all its multi-mode and responsive glory) and the foundational Rock Paper Scissors game (fully polished).
- Began diving into **Object Basics**, starting to grasp fundamental concepts for more complex data structures.
- Kicked off the **Calculator Project**, laying down its initial structure and core logic.
- Made an astounding **70+ commits** today, reflecting an intense, incremental, and highly productive development session.

**What I struggled with:**
- Maintaining the incredibly high pace and focus required to juggle multiple learning modules and project integrations.
- Ensuring every feature was polished and robust in the Etch-A-Sketch project, which demanded meticulous attention to detail.
- The mental bandwidth required to seamlessly transition between theoretical concepts (DOM, Objects) and practical application (projects).

**Tomorrow's goal:**
- **FINISH THE ENTIRE THE ODIN PROJECT FOUNDATIONS COURSE!**
    - Complete Object Basics and associated assignments.
    - Fully complete the Calculator Project, making it portfolio-ready.
    - Tackle any remaining minor Foundations topics (e.g., Git Branching basics if not covered implicitly).
- **Consolidate JavaScript Knowledge:** Initiate a thorough revision of all core JS concepts from `javascript.info`, a focused grind until May 25th.
- **Project Polish & Portfolio Prep:** Refine and rework all current projects and repositories, ensuring they are impeccably presented for the portfolio.
- Aim for high-quality, impactful commits that reflect final touches and comprehensive understanding.

**Wins today:**
- **CRUSHED TWO MAJOR PROJECTS!** Etch-A-Sketch and Rock Paper Scissors are complete, fully functional, and ready to showcase.
- Achieved a massive personal best with **70+ commits** – a testament to incremental progress and relentless effort.
- Gained significant confidence in complex DOM manipulation and event handling.
- Successfully initiated the next big project (Calculator) and started Objects, maintaining forward momentum.
- **Reached 93% completion of The Odin Project Foundations!** The finish line for Foundations is in sight.

This was an absolute powerhouse day, setting up for an even more epic finish. The grind is real, and the results are showing – soon, Foundations will be a thing of the past!
