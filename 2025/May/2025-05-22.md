## Day 10 of 1461: The Odin Journey - FOUNDATIONS CONQUERED!

**What I worked on:**
- Achieved **100% completion of The Odin Project Foundations Course!** This massive milestone includes mastering HTML, CSS, and core JavaScript concepts.
- Successfully brought the **AuraCalc Calculator Project** to a highly polished, portfolio-ready state.
- Implemented a crucial layout fix, ensuring the calculator is perfectly centered on the page without extraneous space.
- Refined the theme toggle's positioning, moving it to the top-right corner of the viewport for a cleaner main interface.
- Managed GitHub repository and local clone renaming for AuraCalc, ensuring project consistency.
- Strategically ordered and pinned all **5 completed portfolio projects** on GitHub for optimal presentation.
- Pushed hard to secure **70+ commits today (AGAIN!)**, maintaining a high pace of incremental progress.

**What I struggled with:**
- Pinpointing the exact CSS adjustments needed to achieve the desired isolated calculator layout, which required precise flexbox and positioning tweaks.
- The final push to tie up all loose ends and ensure all Foundations topics were thoroughly understood and practiced.

**Tomorrow's goal:**
- **Initiate Comprehensive Foundations Revision:** Begin a thorough review of the entire Odin Project Foundations curriculum, focusing on solidifying all core HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts.
- **Project Refinement & Polish:** Dedicate time to refining and polishing existing projects, especially the Flexbox Landing Page, to ensure they are impeccably presented for the portfolio.
- **Prepare for Full Stack JavaScript:** Start preliminary preparation and research for The Odin Project's next curriculum phase: **Full Stack JavaScript**, set to officially begin from May 26th.
- Aim for high-quality, impactful commits that reflect final touches and comprehensive understanding.

**Wins today:**
