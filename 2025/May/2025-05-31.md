## Day 19 of 1461: The Odin Journey - L Day Again :/

**What I worked on:**
- Finished the two final projects of Intermediate HTML + CSS course
- Began with JS course and started its first project

**What I struggled with:**
- Trying to not fall asleep (yes im still sleep deprived from the past 2 days)
- That's it really

**Tomorrow's goal:**
- Finish JS project no. 1 and move ahead with the course
- Recover from sleep deprivation

**Wins today:**
- Nothing crazy honestly. 

Another L day. but we move anyway.
