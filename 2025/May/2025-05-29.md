## Day 17 of 1461: The Odin Journey - L Day

**What I worked on:**
- Nothing much really
- Got done with most of the project.
- That's it really

**What I struggled with:**
- Fell asleep at my desk while making the project
- As a result, couldn't finish the Intermediate HTML & CSS course either

**Tomorrow's goal:**
- Finish up the entire Intermediate HTML & CSS course and begin with the JavaScript course
- Finish up the entirety of **Momentum** & deploy it

**Wins today:**
- Honestly? None.

L day. But we move.
