## Day 16 of 1461: The Odin Journey - New Project

**What I worked on:**
- Finished ~60% of the Intermediate HTML & CSS course in the Full Stack JS Path
- Revised all of the stuff I've learnt on my own through projects
- Began a new project: A habit tracker called **"Momentum"**

**What I struggled with:**
- Honestly? Nothing.

**Tomorrow's goal:**
- Finish up the entire Intermediate HTML & CSS course
- Finish a good chunk of **Momentum** to deploy

**Wins today:**
- Finished a major chunk of the course
- Began a new project even though I wasn't feeling like it

Another day. Another W. Coming back for more.
