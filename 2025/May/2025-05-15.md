Today's Date - 15th May, 2025 (it's currently 2 17 am in the night, the day's already 16th of May)

Grind Summary:

- HTML Foundations done. All clear. Project done and submitted. Updated and deployed on GitHub.
- 10+ commits made today.
- CSS was to be done but mind was unable to focus, so we'll do that first thing tomrrow.

New Learnings/Core Takeaways:

- Basics of HTML (structure of basic HTML pages, importance of semantic tags and cleaner code, README structure clarity, accessibility 101, and so on.)
- Importance of regular and clean commits (and how to make commits the right way.)
- A lot of shortcuts on VS Code.

What I missed and/or will start tomorrow:

- CSS Foundations was to be done today, but due to lack of energy, it has been postponed to tomorrow.
- We'll wrap up Flexbox tomorrow.
- We'll begin the "one comment a day" on a high value dev's post from tomorrow.

Mental Reflection:

- Body and mind are both pretty tired, but the discipline still exists.
- All the goals of today weren't hit. But unfortunately rest karna padega.
- Happy with the progress. Not done yet. We go harder tomorrow.

Day 3 of 1461. We wake up tomorrow and go even harder.
