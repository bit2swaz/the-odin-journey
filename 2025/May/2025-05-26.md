## Day 14 of 1461: The Odin Journey - SwiftType Triumph!

**What I worked on:**
- Dedicated the entire day to SwiftType, tackling a multitude of bugs and refining the UI.
- Pushed through various issues to get the project working super nice and clean.
- Focused on polishing the overall user experience and visual consistency.

**What I struggled with:**
- The sheer volume of unexpected bugs that popped up.
- Ensuring every UI detail and functionality "hit right" as per our discussions.
- The time commitment required to achieve the desired level of polish.

**Tomorrow's goal:**
- Kick off the JS Full Stack path in The Odin Project (one day late, but worth the SwiftType grind!).
- Begin a new, smaller frontend project (a habit tracker) using just basic HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS to solidify core concepts.
- Maintain the momentum from SwiftType's completion into new learning.

**Wins today:**
- SwiftType is looking **SUPERB** and functioning brilliantly â€“ a massive win!
- Successfully navigated and resolved numerous complex bugs, showcasing strong debugging skills.
- Maintained unwavering focus and determination, seeing the project through to a polished state.
- **Delivered on the vision for a truly aesthetic and functional typing test.**

This project was a proper grind today, but seeing it come together so well makes every hour worth it. Time to shift gears for tomorrow, harder and smarter.
