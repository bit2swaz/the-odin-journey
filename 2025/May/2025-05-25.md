## Day 13 of 1461: The Odin Journey - SwiftType Fail?

**What I worked on:**

- Spent the majority of the time trying to fix bugs, errors, and trying to get things to hit perfect.
- Ended up starting fresh for the 2nd time.
- Still in beta. Realised this will take LONG.
- MVPs aren't built in days. It takes WEEKS to master them. We'll get this done soon.

**What I struggled with:**

- Fixing bugs.
- Trying to PERFECT the UI and functionality (to exactly match MonkeyType)

**Tomorrow's goal:**

- Stick with one UI, and go with it till the end
- No starting fresh again
- Dedicate the major part of the day to SwiftType

**Wins today:**

- CRITICAL BUG FIXES DELIVERED!
- Successfully applied **JavaScript revision knowledge** directly to solve complex project bugs.
- Maintained a productive coding rhythm even with **personal commitments**, showcasing improved time management.

Got a lot of hours of work in, but still didn't hit right. Need to go again tomorrow. Harder.
