## Day 13 of 1461: The Odin Journey - SwiftType Fail?

**What I worked on:**
- Spent the majority of the time trying to fix bugs, errors, and trying to get things to hit perfect.
- Ended up starting fresh for the 2nd time.
- Still in beta. Realised this will take LONG.
- MVPs aren't built in days. It takes WEEKS to master them. We'll get this done soon.

**What I struggled with:**
- The persistent nature of the **results screen bug** was particularly frustrating, requiring multiple iterations of debugging to pinpoint the exact CSS/JS conflict.
- Balancing dedicated coding time with **family commitments** meant splitting focus, though ultimately leading to a more refreshed approach to problem-solving.

**Tomorrow's goal:**
- **Implement Custom Footer:** Begin integrating my iconic footer design into SwiftType.
- **Integrate Iconic Themes:** Start bringing over my unique light and dark theme styles and adapting them to the SwiftType UI.
- **Project Planning:** Outline the next set of features and refinements for SwiftType (e.g., custom text, score history) to ensure a clear roadmap.
- Aim for continued stable progress and a clean integration of new UI elements.

**Wins today:**
- **CRITICAL BUG FIXES DELIVERED!** The caret and results screen are now fully operational, making SwiftType genuinely playable.
- Successfully applied **JavaScript revision knowledge** directly to solve complex project bugs.
- Maintained a productive coding rhythm even with **personal commitments**, showcasing improved time management.
- Laid a solid, functional foundation for SwiftType, ready for the next phase of UI/UX enhancements.

Today was all about battling the beasts and emerging victorious! The core functionality of SwiftType is now solid, paving the way for the personalized touches.
