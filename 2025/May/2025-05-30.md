## Day 18 of 1461: The Odin Journey - Coming Back

**What I worked on:**

- Finished **Momentum Habit Tracker**
- Finished Intermediate HTML + CSS course

**What I struggled with:**

- Trying not to fall asleep at my desk
- That's it really

**Tomorrow's goal:**

- Begin with the JavaScript course
- Wrap up Intermediate HTML + CSS course's projects, polish, and refine them.

**Wins today:**

- Main project is wrapped up
- Intermediate HTML + CSS course is finished. JS has begun!

Decent day honestly. But we will do better.
