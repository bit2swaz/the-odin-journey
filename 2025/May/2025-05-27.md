## Day 15 of 1461: The Odin Journey - Back to learning

**What I worked on:**

- Dedicated a good portion of my time to tackling a multitude of bugs and refining the UI.
- Pushed through various issues to get the project working super nice and clean.
- Finally started with the Full Stack JS Course in The Odin Project.

**What I struggled with:**

- The sheer volume of unexpected bugs that popped up.
- Took me 3 hours to fix one bug, only for 2 more to take up its place. When I tried fixing that, then the initial one popped up again. Ended up finishing off where I started from.

**Tomorrow's goal:**

- Get done with a good chunk of intermediate HTML and CSS course
- Begin some kind of a new project

**Wins today:**

- Successfully navigated and resolved numerous complex bugs, showcasing strong debugging skills.
- Maintained unwavering focus and determination, seeing the project through to a polished state.

Didn't really feel like a productive day since it wasn't spent building something, but I guess fixing bugs is part of making a product too. I'll get used to it.
