## Day 11 of 1461: The Odin Journey - Polishing & Pivoting

**What I worked on:**
- Deep dived into **HTML & CSS revision**, solidifying foundational concepts and best practices.
- Significantly upgraded and polished the **Flexbox Landing Page project**, transforming it into a portfolio-ready showcase.
- Implemented a dynamic **dark/light mode toggle** with persistent local storage, enhancing user experience and demonstrating advanced CSS variable usage.
- Integrated **interactive dropdown menus** with comprehensive keyboard navigation, greatly improving accessibility and UI/UX.
- Added a smooth **"back to top" button**, refining overall site usability.
- Secured **40+ GitHub commits** today, reflecting focused progress and consistent iteration on existing work.

**What I struggled with:**
- Finding the perfect **color palette for both light and dark modes** on the landing page proved surprisingly challenging, requiring considerable time and iteration to achieve the desired aesthetic balance.
- Unfortunately, I wasn't able to fit in my planned **JavaScript revision** today, as the design and implementation of the landing page's new features took precedence.

**Tomorrow's goal:**
- **Dedicated JavaScript Revision:** Prioritize a comprehensive review of core JavaScript concepts.
- **Further Project Refinement:** Continue polishing existing projects, addressing any lingering bugs and adding detailed code comments for improved maintainability.
- **Brainstorming New Projects:** Explore ideas for a self-initiated project focused on solving a real-world problem using my current programming knowledge.
- Aim for high-quality, impactful commits that showcase clear understanding and attention to detail.

**Wins today:**
- Successfully **transformed the Flexbox Landing Page** into a robust, feature-rich, and portfolio-worthy project.
- Mastered the implementation of **dynamic theming and accessible dropdowns**, showcasing advanced front-end skills.
- Maintained strong development discipline with **40+ commits**, demonstrating continuous effort and commitment.
