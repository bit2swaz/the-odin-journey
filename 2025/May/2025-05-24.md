## Day 12 of 1461: The Odin Journey - SwiftType Resurgence

**What I worked on:**

- Dedicated a significant portion of the day to the **SwiftType project**, pushing through critical bug fixes and refining core functionality.
- Successfully resolved the elusive **caret visibility and positioning bugs**, ensuring the typing indicator now behaves as expected.
- **Fixed the results screen display issue**, which was previously preventing the test results from appearing after the timer ended. Now, WPM, accuracy, and detailed character counts are visible.
- Confirmed the **Tab key restart functionality** is robust and working 100%.
- Conducted a **dedicated JavaScript revision session**, solidifying understanding of event handling, DOM manipulation, and project state management, which directly contributed to the SwiftType fixes.

**What I struggled with:**

- The persistent nature of the **results screen bug** was particularly frustrating, requiring multiple iterations of debugging to pinpoint the exact CSS/JS conflict.
- Balancing dedicated coding time with **family commitments** meant splitting focus, though ultimately leading to a more refreshed approach to problem-solving.

**Tomorrow's goal:**

- **Implement Custom Footer:** Begin integrating my iconic footer design into SwiftType.
- **Integrate Iconic Themes:** Start bringing over my unique light and dark theme styles and adapting them to the SwiftType UI.
- **Project Planning:** Outline the next set of features and refinements for SwiftType (e.g., custom text, score history) to ensure a clear roadmap.
- Aim for continued stable progress and a clean integration of new UI elements.

**Wins today:**

- **CRITICAL BUG FIXES DELIVERED!** The caret and results screen are now fully operational, making SwiftType genuinely playable.
- Successfully applied **JavaScript revision knowledge** directly to solve complex project bugs.
- Maintained a productive coding rhythm even with **personal commitments**, showcasing improved time management.
- Laid a solid, functional foundation for SwiftType, ready for the next phase of UI/UX enhancements.

Today was all about battling the beasts and emerging victorious! The core functionality of SwiftType is now solid, paving the way for the personalized touches.
