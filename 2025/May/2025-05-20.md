## Day 8 of 1461: The Odin Journey

**What I worked on:**

- Completed all remaining Arrays and Loops assingments from Foundations (including repeatString, reverseString, removeFromArray, etc.)
- Started with DOM Manipulation module
- Made 15+ commits today
- Pushed myself despite major mental fatigue

**What I struggled with:**

- Arrays and loops took WAY longer than expected. Could read code but struggled to write from scratch
- Almost gave up during the assignments due to mental exhaustion and frustration
- DOM concepts felt overwhelming after that, couldn't absorb too much by the end

**Tomorrow's goal:**

- Finish the entire Foundations course:
  - DOM Manipulation + Events
  - RPS Project UI + DOM Update
  - Git Branching basics
  - Etch-A-Sketch Project
  - Objects Basics
  - Final Calculator Project
- Push at least 5-6 quality commits.

**Wins today:**

- Fought through mental resistance and didnâ€™t give up
- Finally understood loops better after brute-forcing the assignments
- Locked in the Fullstack JS Path decision (Node.js + MongoDB)
- Maintained the daily habit stack (logs, posts, grind) despite burnout

Tough day. We fall. But we come back up even harder.
