##  Day 5 of 1461: The Odin Journey

**What I worked on:**
- Finished the entire Flexbox section from The Odin Project.
- Completed the final landing page project: [Live Link](https://bit2swaz.github.io/flexbox-landing-page/) | [Repo](https://github.com/bit2swaz/flexbox-landing-page)
- Learnt + applied:
  - Box model, flex-direction, justify/align content
  - Responsive layout building
  - Header, hero, quote, CTA, and footer section structuring
  - Smooth-scroll using anchor links
  - Started working on dropdown menus for nav (hover-based logic)

**What I struggled with:**
- Font-weight on italic quotes not showing up
- Getting hover/transition consistency across buttons
- Positioning sections in the exact layout from the reference image

**Tomorrow's goal:**
- Begin JavaScript Basics (Was supposed to do this today but spent WAY too long on the project)
- Reach and complete the Rock-Paper-Scissors project
- If possible, start building DOM-based interactivity on existing projects

**Wins today:**
- Finished my first fully structured project without handholding
- Sharpened CSS intuition massively through trial + tweaks
- Shipped it publicly â€” no perfection, just progress

I'm proud of this one.
