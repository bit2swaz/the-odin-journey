## Day 56 of 1461: Literally Gave Up

**What I worked on:**

- Spent the whole day trying to work the link shortener project out
- Didn't work
- Ended up abandoning it

**What I struggled with:**

- Making AI code.

**Tomorrow's goal:**

- Maybe start over.
- Or start a new project entirely

**Wins today:**

- Done with the learning phase of the T3 stack! So fun.

Another day. Another W. Not done yet.
