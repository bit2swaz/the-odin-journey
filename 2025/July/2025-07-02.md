## Day 51 of 1461: Almost Done w/ TS!

**What I worked on:**

- Most of the day was spent sleeping (gotta pay my debts right)
- Some TS.

**What I struggled with:**

- Staying awake (yes, this is eternal)

**Tomorrow's goal:**

- Finish TS and start with Next.js 15.

**Wins today:**

- Past the revision phase and finally into the revision phase!

Another day. Another W. Not done yet.
