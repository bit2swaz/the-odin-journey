## Day 52 of 1461: Next.js is almost finished

**What I worked on:**

- Most of the day was spent on Next.js (about 6.5 hours)
- That's it

**What I struggled with:**

- Nothing, really.

**Tomorrow's goal:**

- Finish Next.js and explore Tailwind, shadcn/ui, etc. and begin working on projects.

**Wins today:**

- Past the revision phase and finally into the revision phase!

Another day. Another W. Not done yet.
