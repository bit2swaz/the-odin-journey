## Day 50 of 1461: Halfway Through TypeScript!

**What I worked on:**

- Spent some time learning about TS.
- Boring day honestly.

**What I struggled with:**

- Staying awake (yes, this is eternal)

**Tomorrow's goal:**

- Finish TS and start with Next.js 15.

**Wins today:**

- Past the revision phase and finally into the revision phase!

Another day. Another W. Not done yet.
