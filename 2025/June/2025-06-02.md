## Day 22 of 1461: WE'RE SO BACK!

**What I worked on:**
- Switched from VS Code to Cursor
- Revised JS basics
- Moved forward with JS course, finished 2nd project (Tic Tac Toe)

**What I struggled with:**
- Grasping new concepts
- That's it really

**Tomorrow's goal:**
- Finish up another major chunk of the JS course
- Come up with a new project idea to finish by this week (2 projects)

**Wins today:**
- Got followed by an SDE from RazorPay with over 1k followers (more context on Discord @topjesus)
- Finished up 2 projects in the time I would usually finish 1

Another day. Another W.
