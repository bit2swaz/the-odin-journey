## Day 27 of 1461: React Finished (almost)

**What I worked on:**
- Getting Started w/ React, Keys, Components, States and Effects, etc.
- CV Application Builder Project
- Memory Card Game Project

**What I struggled with:**
- Sleep deprivation (as always)

**Tomorrow's goal:**
- Finish the React course
- If time permits, polish up previous projects

**Wins today:**
- 50% through with the React course in **ONE DAY**.

Another day. Another W. not done yet.
