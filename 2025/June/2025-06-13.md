## Day 33 of 1461: Photo Tagging App Project!

**What I worked on:**
- Started the "Where's Waldo" Photo Tagging App Project
- That's literally it.
- My whole day of work (around 10 hours) was spent on this project (and we're not even done yet)

**What I struggled with:**
- Still unsure how I'm gonna find the images that I need for this project
- UI still needs a lot of work
- So does the database linking

**Tomorrow's goal:**
- Continue working on the Where's Waldo project
- Maybe learn some new technologies I might wanna use on this project
- Maybe start the Messaging App project

**Wins today:**
- Where's Waldo project is started, and I'm about 60% done.

Another day. Another W. not done yet.
