## Day 48 of 1461: Revision Day 

**What I worked on:**
- Jaipur trip (14 hours spent there)
- Some part of the day was spent coding (about 3 hour)

**What I struggled with:**
- Staying awake (running on less than 1 hour of sleep)

**Tomorrow's goal:**
- PERN Stack revision, mini projects

**Wins today:**
- Revision is hella boring. But we still on it

Another day. Another W. Not done yet.
