## Day 46 of 1461: Revision Day 9

**What I worked on:**
- A good bit of the day was spent doing college stuff (Bank account, shopping, etc.)
- Some part of the day was spent coding (about 1 hour)

**What I struggled with:**
- Staying awake (running on less than 1 hour of sleep)

**Tomorrow's goal:**
- Try to wrap up DSA in JS course (freeCodeCamp)
- Refer to javascript.info wherever needed

**Wins today:**
- Revision is hella boring. But we still on it

Another day. Another W. Not done yet.
