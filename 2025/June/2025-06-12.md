## Day 32 of 1461: APIs and Testing Express

**What I worked on:**
- Learnt about APIs and Testing Express
- Worked on the blog API project (deployement hell AGAIN!)
- Started the final 2 full stack projects (Where's Waldo (Photo Tagging App) and Messaging App)

**What I struggled with:**
- debugging. LOTS OF DEBUGGING
- deploying. project still isn't deployed.
- testing. I'm not sure how to test the API.

**Tomorrow's goal:**
- Start the Where's Waldo project
- Maybe learn some new technologies I might wanna use on this project

**Wins today:**
- Blog API project is finished, worked locally. Not deployed yet.

Another day. Another W. not done yet.
