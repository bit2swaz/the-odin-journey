## Day 21 of 1461: 3rd week OVER! - Gaining Momentum

(Note: It should've been day 20, but for the sake of simplicity, I've moved one day forward)

**What I worked on:**

- Went back to revise JS basics
- Continued with the JS course.

**What I struggled with:**

- Trying to not fall asleep (yes im still sleep deprived from the past 2 days)
- That's it really

**Tomorrow's goal:**

- Finish JS project no. 1 and move ahead with the course
- Recover from sleep deprivation

**Wins today:**

- Nothing crazy honestly.

SLOWLY gaining momentum.
