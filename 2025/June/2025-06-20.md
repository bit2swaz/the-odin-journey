## Day 40 of 1461: Revision Day 2

**What I worked on:**
- Left the freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course at about 80% (revised all concepts)
- Began working on freeCodeCamp's DSA in JS course

**What I struggled with:**
- Nothing really

**Tomorrow's goal:**
- At least 20% of DSA in JS
- Refer to javascript.info wherever needed

**Wins today:**
- Revision is hella boring. But we still on it

Another day. Another W. Not done yet.
