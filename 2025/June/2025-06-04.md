## Day 24 of 1461: JS Course Almost Finished

**What I worked on:**
- Async JS & APIs
- Boilerplate Projects (Polished todo-list app, made weather app) 

**What I struggled with:**
- Just grasping concepts as a whole at once

**Tomorrow's goal:**
- Finish entire JS course along with the projects
- Begin Advanced HTML & CSS course

**Wins today:**
- A HUGE chunk of JS course is covered alr, at a very good pace
- Nothing flashy really

In the not-so-flashy phase right now. But we'll be up soon. Big things are coming up.
