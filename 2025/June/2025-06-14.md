## Day 34 of 1461: Deployment Hell (again)

**What I worked on:**
- Finished making and polishing the Photo Tagging App project
- Spent 4 hours on just deploying (only to end up failing)
- Made a Father's Day website to send to my dad (frontend only, basic HTML, CSS and vanilla JS)

**What I struggled with:**
- Deployment.

**Tomorrow's goal:**
- Learn some new technologies like Tailwind, ShadCN/UI, etc.
- Start new project (Messaging App)

**Wins today:**
- Photo Tagging App done.
- Father's Day project done.

Another day. Another W. not done yet.
