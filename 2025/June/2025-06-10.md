## Day 30 of 1461: AUTHENTICATION HELL

**What I worked on:**
- Learnt authentication basics and its applications
- Spent the entire day making this one project (Members only message board)

**What I struggled with:**
- debugging. LOTS OF DEBUGGING
- linking frontend to backend and database

**Tomorrow's goal:**
- Finish Prisma ORM
- Start and finish APIs
- Learn about Testing Express
- Begin the final 2 full stack projects (Where's Waldo (Photo Tagging App) and Messaging App)

**Wins today:**
- First project ever with basic authentication, proper front and backend, FINISHED!

Another day. Another W. not done yet.
