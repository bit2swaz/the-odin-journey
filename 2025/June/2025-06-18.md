## Day 38 of 1461: Rest Day

**What I worked on:**
- Spent the entire day sleeping (about 9 hours of sleep)
- Most of the day was spent wandering about college stuff

**What I struggled with:**
- Nothing really

**Tomorrow's goal:**
- Finish FCC's HTML and CSS course (Responsive Web Design)

**Wins today:**
- The fact that I took a day off maybe? I'm not sure.

Another day. Another W. Not done yet.
