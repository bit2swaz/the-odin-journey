## Day 26 of 1461: Onto React!

**What I worked on:**
- Advanced HTML & CSS
- Homepage Project (key focus on responsiveness)
- Learning about these AI IDEs

**What I struggled with:**
- Nothing really

**Tomorrow's goal:**
- Begin the React course
- That's it really

**Wins today:**
- The ENTIRE ADVANCED HTML & CSS COURSE is finished
- Made homepage for future portfolio. Looks good.

Another day. Another W. not done yet.
