## Day 42 of 1461: Revision Day 5

**What I worked on:**
- I am a day late, so I kinda don't remember exactly what I did

**What I struggled with:**
- Staying awake.

**Tomorrow's goal:**
- At least 50% of DSA in JS
- Refer to javascript.info wherever needed

**Wins today:**
- Revision is hella boring. But we still on it

Another day. Another W. Not done yet.
