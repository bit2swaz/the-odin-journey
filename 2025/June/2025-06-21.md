## Day 40 of 1461: Revision Day 3

**What I worked on:**
- Finished 1st mini project of the DSA in JS course (freeCodeCamp)
- Covered arrays, strings, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, form validation, DOM Manipulation, string and array methods, etc.

**What I struggled with:**
- Nothing really

**Tomorrow's goal:**
- At least 40% of DSA in JS
- Refer to javascript.info wherever needed

**Wins today:**
- Revision is hella boring. But we still on it

Another day. Another W. Not done yet.
