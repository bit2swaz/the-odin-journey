## Day 49 of 1461: Revision Is Over!

**What I worked on:**
- Lethargic ass day (Probably because of less sleep)
- Started with Theo's T3 stack.

**What I struggled with:**
- Staying awake (running on less than 6 hour of sleep)

**Tomorrow's goal:**
- Project based learning for T3.

**Wins today:**
- Past the revision phase and finally into the revision phase!

Another day. Another W. Not done yet.
