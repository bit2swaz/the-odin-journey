## Day 25 of 1461: JS Course DEMOLISHED!

**What I worked on:**
- Recursion, Time and Space Complexity, DSA, Linked Lists, Hashmaps, BSTs, etc.
- Deeper dive into Git
- JS Testing (Mostly Jest)
- A few basic projects to solidify conceptual understanding

**What I struggled with:**
- Keeping myself awake

**Tomorrow's goal:**
- Begin Advanced HTML & CSS course (and finish it too)
- Start working on QuoteShot
- If possible, begin a little bit of React

**Wins today:**
- The ENTIRE JS COURSE is finished
- Did DSA for the first time. It was alright. I prefer project development

Crossed ONE HUGE MOUNTAIN. onto the next. not done yet. Another day. Another W.
